# Edge cases
`Encode` followed by `Decode` does not produce the original stream of integers in the following edge cases:
1. In some cases where the input stream ends in error (see [issue 2](https://github.com/projectriff-samples/java-run-length-encoding/issues/2)).
2. When the size of a run exceeds the maximum value of the integer type used in the implementation.
3. When `Encode` or `Decode` runs out of memory.
